-----------------------------------------------
## Environment Set Up

Language: Scala\
Build System: sbt\
JDK: corretto-17 Amazon Corretto version 17.0.7\
sbt: 1.8.3\
Scala: 2.13.10\
I have used the Intellij IDE to have a go at this assignment
-----------------------------------------------------
## How to run this code

I will provide the code in the email as a zip file and will also provide a GitHub link to the repository\
To run the code you can run the Main.scala code as I have left the code to call for the function in at the end\
I recommend running the code in Intellij as that is what I used to build the soultion however I believe you can run in command prompt by using the following steps\
Add Scala to the system's PATH:

    Locate the directory where Scala is installed on your system.
    Add the directory to the system's PATH environment variable.
    Restart your terminal or command prompt.
    Now you should be able to use the scala command without specifying the full path.

Copy the code and save it to a file named Main.scala\
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved Main.scala\
Run the code using the scala command with the -e option:\

    scala -e "$(cat Main.scala)"

This command reads the contents of Main.scala and executes it directly without the need for compilation\
You will see the prompt Please input your items in the command line first input should be PriceBasket\
You can then input your shopping items as instructed and see the output
